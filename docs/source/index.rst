Welcome to Flexynesis documentation!
===================================

Flexynesis is a deep-learning based multi-omics bulk sequencing data integration suite with a focus on (pre-)clinical
endpoint prediction. The package includes multiple types of deep learning architectures such as simple
fully connected networks, supervised variational autoencoders; different options of data layer fusion,
and automates feature selection and hyperparameter optimisation. The tools are continuously benchmarked
on publicly available datasets mostly related to the study of cancer. Some of the applications of the methods
we develop are drug response modeling in cancer patients or preclinical models (such as cell lines and
patient-derived xenografts), cancer subtype prediction, or any other clinically relevant outcome prediction
that can be formulated as a regression or classification problem.
